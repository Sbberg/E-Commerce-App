# E-Commerce-App
Revature Training Project 2. The E-Commerce App
In this project we developed an application for buying Funko Pops

# Technologies
Our application was created using Java, Javascript, Html, and CSS languages while we used Intellij and Visual studios code for working on the Back-End and Front-End of our application respectively.

# What's Included
With this E-Commerce application users are capable of:
1) Signing up
  -Where a pop up window will appear and allow the user to create a new account that is then recorded in our database
2) Logging in
  -The user is able to use their credentials from the database to access our application's main page and functions
3) Homepage/Adding Products to Cart
  -Here the user can choose products they like and add them to the cart saving their data and will later be able to be bought at checkout
4) Checkout
  -Where any products that were in the cart can be purchased
