# E-Commerce-App
This group project was completed as part of the Revature Java-Angular-AWS training program. For our E-Commerce project, we developed an application for purchasing Funko Pops!

With this project being a training program assignment, it was a learning experience full of learning opportunities! This was our first project working on a team, while also working remotely, so we collaborated our schedules often to be able to work together. We also communicated what each person was working on, that way when we'd push to our GitHub repository there were minimal merge conflicts. When it came to assigning responsibilities, we went off of who felt the most confident in what!

# Technologies
Our application was created using Java, Spring Boot, Javascript, HTML, and CSS languages. 

We used IntelliJ and Visual Studio Code for working on the Back-End and Front-End of our application respectively. 

We also used DBeaver as our database management system.

# What's Included
With this E-Commerce application users are capable of:
1) Logging In - On the first page users are able to use their credentials from the database to access our application's home page and functions.
2) Signing Up - Also on the first page, a pop-up window will appear and allow the user to create a new account that is then recorded in our database.
3) Adding Products to Cart in Homepage - Once logged in, our Funko Pop products are displayed and users can add them to their cart using a drop-down menu for the quantity. Their data is saved to local storage and they'll be able to purchase the items during checkout.
4) Finalizing their Shopping Cart - Here the quantity the user selected will displayed next to their chosen products. They can also add or remove items from their cart before proceeding to checkout.  
5) Checking Out - Once a user is satisfied with their selection, they'll be redirected here to complete their purchase!

# Enjoy!
